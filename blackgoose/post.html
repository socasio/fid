<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <em>sous vide</em>. In <em>sous vide</em> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <i>Cooking for Geeks</i>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
